## 🧠 About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in **Vehicle Engineering (Intelligent Driving and Artificial Intelligence)** at **Tongji University (985 / Double First-Class)**, Shanghai.  
Before that, I completed my B.Eng. in Vehicle Engineering (Automotive Electronics and Intelligence) at the same university.  

My research lies at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics**, and **Machine Learning**, focusing on **LiDAR-based 3D generation, multi-modal fusion, and scene reconstruction**.  
I am passionate about exploring how generative models (e.g., diffusion, neural fields) can enhance perception and simulation in autonomous driving.

## 🔬 Research Experience

### 🌀 LiDARDraft: Generating LiDAR Point Cloud from Versatile Inputs  
*(Under Review at AAAI 2026, First Author)*  
2024.06 – 2025.06  
Unified text, image, and point cloud into a shared **3D layout** representation, converted into semantic and depth control signals.  
Adopted **ControlNet** to guide unconditional LiDAR generation based on **Stable Diffusion**, achieving high-quality “zero-to-simulation” generation with both flexibility and geometric consistency.

---

### 🧭 GeoNLF: Geometry-guided Pose-Free Neural LiDAR Fields  
*(Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, Fourth Author)*  
2023.09 – 2024.05  
Proposed a hybrid framework alternating between neural reconstruction and geometric pose optimization.  
Introduced **selective weighted geometry constraints** to improve pose-free NeRF optimization stability.

---

### 🌈 MUP: Multimodal LiDAR–Camera Novel View Synthesis  
*(Accepted at NeurIPS 2026, Fifth Author)*  
2024.05 – 2025.05  
Developed **MUP (Multimodal Unified Pose-free)**, a LiDAR–camera fusion framework for large-scale view synthesis without pose supervision.  
Provided continuous depth supervision through LiDAR fields, improving robustness of pose-free image synthesis.

### 🎥 Efficient Trajectory-Conditioned Text-to-4D Gaussian Splatting  
*(Submitted to ICRA 2026, Third Author)*  
2024.09 – 2025.08  
Explored **4D trajectory-conditioned video generation** using HexPlane spatiotemporal representations combined with Stable Diffusion, DreamGaussian, and Stable Video Diffusion.  
Achieved geometrically and temporally consistent video synthesis aligned with trajectory inputs.
